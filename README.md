🏊‍♂️ Piscine Python Django
🏊‍♂️ What is a piscine?

Much like the selection piscine, the project is split in many small projects (days), and with each day a new notion on the language/paradigm/technology you chose to work on. Each weekend offers you the possibility to do a rush, a group project with a random student matched with you. Validating a piscine requires more than just a day or two of investment.

We are looking at:

Your investment on both weeks: you can’t validate the piscine if you work only one week
Trying to turn in every day: even if something isn’t finished, it’s better to try and turn it in
At least one weekend of work: going into the piscine shouldn’t be taken lightly. We expect you to validate at least one of the two rushes.
After the end of the piscine, you have two weeks to do all the required peerevaluations
